<h1>These are video demos of few of my projects in deep learning. Other projects are either tied to an NDA or inaccessible to me due to COVID. I will update them as soon as I am able to access my main machine.</h1>

<h2><strong>Repeat Action Counting in Videos:</strong></h2>
<p>I used Deep Learning to count the frequency of a repeating motion. This project was a proof of concept made for a gymnasium which wanted to track its client's progress. It is an implementation of the paper "Live Repetition Counting".&nbsp;</p>

<div class="embed-container">This project was done as a part of the "AI for Social Good" Hackathon organised by e-Zest Solutions Pune in which<strong> I bagged the runner's up position. </strong>It generates captions for images in front of it(through a webcam) and then using speech to text, I was able to speak it up out loud.</div>
