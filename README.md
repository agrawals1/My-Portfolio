<h2><strong>Repeat Action Counting in Videos:</strong></h2>
<p>I used Deep Learning to count the frequency of a repeating motion. This project was a proof of concept made for a gymnasium which wanted to track its client's progress. It is an implementation of the paper "Live Repetition Counting".&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="embed-container"><strong>Real Time emotion Detection:</strong></h2>
<div class="embed-container">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="embed-container">This was one of my first projects in deep learning. using OpenCV, I parsed individual frames from a webcam and sent it to a deep learning image classifier.</div>

<div class="embed-container"><strong> PLEASE USE EARPHONES TO LISTEN TO THE GENERATED CAPTIONS. THE SUBTITLES PROVIDED ARE WRITTEN BY ME FOR CLARITY SAKE, BUT THE AUDIO IS GENERATED BY THE MODEL. </strong>This project was done as a part of the "AI for Social Good" Hackathon organised by e-Zest Solutions Pune in which<strong> I bagged the runner's up position. </strong>It generates captions for images in front of it(through a webcam) and then using speech to text, I was able to speak it up out loud.</div>

<h2 class="embed-container"><strong>Content Based Image Retrieval with Relevance Feedback</strong></h2>
<div class="embed-container">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="embed-container">This was my major project in college. It is an implementation of the paper "Relevance Feedback in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Content Based Image Retrieval". The aim of the paper is to retrieve images similar to a given input image by comparing the input image representations with the representations of the images in the database. Then using a feedback network, improve the retrieval accuracy.In the demo, I selected the aeroplane image as input image and the model spit out the top 10 images(from the dataset of 101 classes) which it thinks is the closest to the input image.The dataset used was CALTECH 101</div>

I will update them as soon as I am able to access my main machine.</h3>
